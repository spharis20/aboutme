			<h1> Shateequa Studio</h1>


			<p> Hi! My name is Shateequa and I'm just a regula, degula girl from the Bronx. I grew up in a family that truly belieced in giving back to the community. We were always volunteering and participating in activities that were beneficial for our community. Growing up like this made me into a regula, degula humanitarian and now I am here.

			When I say here I am talking about my current position in life. I run a small nonprofit in NYC that creates safe spaces for wellness, community building and more. My main goal in this lifetime is to create a huge impact on this world. I want to invest in bettering our communities and I truly want to be known for that. 

			I plan to use my AgTech experience to build on what I already do in the community. One of my hopes is to get building owners to invest in rooftop gardens or farms for their residents throughout the world. This world needs some love and I am here to shower it with mine.</p>
